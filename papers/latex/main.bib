  abstract  = "In this final installment of the paper we consider the case
               where the signals or the messages or both are continuously
               variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until
               now. To a considerable extent the continuous case can be
               obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by
               dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but
               finite number of small regions and calculating the various
               parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the
               regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as
               limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are,
               however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change
               of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general
               results to particular cases.",
